	I started my Ph.D at University of Southern California in Fall 2011, under the supervise of Professor <a href="http://infolab.usc.edu/Shahabi/">
	    <span class="s3">Cyrus Shahabi</span></a>. I have been working in several projects, iCampus, 
	<a href="http://imsc.usc.edu/iwatch.html"><span class="s3">iWatch</span></a> and 
	<a href="http://mediaq.usc.edu/"><span class="s3">MediaQ</span></a>.
	My research focuses on spatial crowdsourcing, particularly scalability of task assignment and privacy.
	My past industry/research experience includes large-scale distributed systems, services on social networks, 
	search engine and high performance computing.
